The CommentCoreLibrary is a set of Javascript modules that make up the
core controller for comments streaming on top of timed media (video or audio).
It is intended as a catalyst for the development of timed "danmaku" comments
in HTML5.

Developers willing to incorporate similar comment streaming functionalities
inside their own projects (whether web based or not) are encouraged to learn
from and extend from the CommentCoreLibrary.
